## Data Storage

This is a demo application that uses browser LocalStorage for data persistence. Data includes:
- User authentication state
- Question papers (with base64-encoded file data)
- Answer sheets (with base64-encoded file data)

**Note**: LocalStorage has size limitations (~5-10MB depending on browser). For production use, implement a proper backend with file storage.

## Responsive Design

The application is fully responsive and works on:
- Desktop computers
- Tablets
- Mobile phones

## Code Organization

The code is structured for beginners with:
- Clear component separation
- Utility functions for reusable logic
- TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- Simple state management with React hooks
- Clean, readable code with comments

## Future Enhancements

For a production-ready version, consider:
- Real authentication system
- Backend API with database
- File storage service (e.g., AWS S3, Supabase Storage)
- Grading and feedback system
- Email notifications
- Advanced search and filters
- File preview functionality
- Role-based permissions
